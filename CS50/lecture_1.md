## Binary and Base Systems
Decimal is the number system taught in early mathematics, it comprises of the digits from **0 - 9**.

An example of how a decimal number is actually understood by modern mathematics is the following:

`524 = 5 x 10^3 + 2 x 10^2 + 4 x 10^1`

The reason for this comes from how number systems work, there are a total of 10 digits which can be written using decimal format, we therefore consider this format to be a base 10 number system. This means that when we write a number in decimal, the value of each digit is in turn the product of multiplying itself with 10 raised to the power of its index. It is important to note that the indexes of written digits start from 1 and work backwards such that the last digit of a number will have index 1 and the first digit will have an index equal to the total number of digits.
